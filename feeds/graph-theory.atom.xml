the last couple of days without success. The result was published by Sir
Crispin Nash-Williams as &lt;em&gt;Valency Sequences which force graphs to have
Hamiltonian Circuits&lt;/em&gt;. Interim Rep, University of Waterloo Res Rep.,
Waterloo, Ontario, 1969. However, this old paper is unavailable online
but I have a proof in some lecture notes from my class, that I want to
share&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; Let [latex]G=(V, E)[/latex] be an [latex]n[/latex]-regular
graph with [latex]|V| = 2n + 1[/latex]. Then, [latex]G[/latex] is&amp;nbsp;Hamiltonian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof.&lt;/strong&gt; We first remark that [latex]n[/latex] must be even, since
$$\sum_{x \in V} d(x) = n(2n + 1) = 2|E|$$ We might try to apply
Dirac&amp;#8217;s theorem, which would give us a Hamiltonian cycle if [latex]
\forall x \in V, d(x) \geq \frac{|V|}{2}[/latex]. But in the current
case, [latex]\forall x \in V, d(x) = n \&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;\frac{2n+1}{2}[/latex].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we force Dirac by adding an extra vertex [latex]w[/latex] and
connecting it to all [latex] x \in V [/latex]. In this new graph
[latex]G&amp;#8217;[/latex], [latex]d(x) = n + 1 \forall x \in V[/latex] and
[latex]d(w) = 2n + 1[/latex]. Therefore we have a Hamiltonian cycle that
passes through [latex]w[/latex] and in which, [latex]w[/latex] is
adjacent to two vertices [latex]x[/latex] and [latex]y \in V[/latex].
Therefore this cycle induces a Hamiltonian path in [latex]G[/latex]:
$$P = [x = v_0, v_1, &amp;#8230;, v_{2n-1}, v_{2n}=y]&amp;nbsp;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that [latex]G[/latex] is not Hamiltonian. It follows that if
[latex] v_0v_i \in E [/latex], then [latex] v_{i-1}v_{2n} \notin
E[/latex] and also that if [latex] v_0v_i \notin E [/latex], then
[latex] v_{i-1}v_{2n} \in&amp;nbsp;E[/latex].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two cases. If [latex]v_0[/latex] is adjacent to [latex]v_1,
&amp;#8230;, v_n[/latex] then it follows that [latex]v_{2n}[/latex] is
adjacent to [latex]v_n, v_{n+1}, &amp;#8230;, v_{2n-1}[/latex], since it
cannot be adjacent to any [latex]v_i, i \&amp;lt; n[/latex] without creating a
Hamiltonian cycle. But in this case, in the graph induced by the first
half [latex]G[\{v_0, v_1, &amp;#8230; v_n\}][/latex], [latex]v_n[/latex]
cannot be adjacent to all the others, since in [latex]G[/latex] it has
degree [latex]n[/latex] and it already has [latex]2[/latex] outgoing
edges. So there is at least one vertex [latex]v_i, i \&amp;lt; n[/latex] that
isn&amp;#8217;t adjacent to it, which means [latex]v_i[/latex] is adjacent to
some [latex]v_j, j &amp;gt; n[/latex], thus forming a Hamiltonian&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second case, we have a vertex [latex]v_i, 2 \leq i \leq 2n -
1[/latex] such that [latex]v_0v_i \notin E[/latex] and
[latex]v_0v_{i+1} \in E[/latex]. This also means that
[latex]v_{i-1}v_{2n} \in&amp;nbsp;E[/latex].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore have a cycle of length [latex]2n[/latex] in
[latex]G[/latex] that excludes [latex]v_i[/latex]. Let&amp;#8217;s rename this
cycle [latex]C=[y_1, y_2, &amp;#8230;, y_{2n}, y_1][/latex] and&amp;nbsp;[latex]v_i=y_0[/latex].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[latex]y_0[/latex] cannot be adjacent to two consecutive vertices
[latex]y_i[/latex] and [latex]y_{i+1}[/latex] because this will give a
Hamiltonian cycle. But we know that [latex]deg(y_0) = n[/latex]. It
follows that it&amp;#8217;s adjacent to all of the even or odd numbered vertices.
We assume the latter, without loss of generality. Let [latex]2k[/latex]
be some even index. Notice that we have [latex]\{y_0y_{2k-1},
y_0y_{2k+1}\} \subset E[/latex] and we can follow the cycle
[latex]C[/latex] from [latex]y_{2k+1}[/latex] all the way back to
[latex]y_{2n-1}[/latex] giving us a new cycle [latex]C&amp;#8217; = [y_1, y_2,
&amp;#8230;, y_{2n-1}, y_0, y_{2k+1}, &amp;#8230;, y_{2n}, y_1][/latex] also of
length [latex]2n[/latex]. So by repeating the same reasoning for every
even vertex, by placing it in the middle and building a cycle around it,
it follows that every even vertex is adjacent to all the odd vertices.
But there are [latex]n+1[/latex] even indices, so it follows that the
degree of any odd vertex is at least [latex]n+1[/latex], contradicting
the initial conditions of the theorem.&amp;nbsp;[latex]\square[/latex]&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="graph theory"/><category term="graph"/><category term="graph theory"/><category term="hamiltonian"/><category term="nash-williams"/><category term="Uncategorized"/></entry></feed>
