    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Anybody reading my blog should have expected me to blog about the end of
my GSoC. Sorry to disappoint, but I simply did not experience anything
similar to an ending. On the contrary, I feel like things have barely
started. Also, I apologize for one of the few posts here without pretty
pictures!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>For the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve been traveling. I attended the EuroScipy
conference thanks to Fabian, who offered me a place to sleep during the
week. We sprinted hard, we discussed tricky APIs, we drank a lot of
coffee, beer, and ate well in lovely Paris. It was great to meet all of
the celebrities, the people who keep the scientific Python globe&nbsp;turning.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Gael and Emmanuelle, who worked very, very hard on
organizing everything, so they weren&#8217;t around and I didn&#8217;t get to say
goodbye when I ran to catch my plane last&nbsp;Sunday.</p>
<p>I was in a hurry, heading to Tarragona, a beautiful city on the Catalan
coast, where the public university organized the 2011 summer school in
linguistics and speech technologies (<span class="caps">SSLST</span>). This was a great
opportunity to meet many fellow young researchers working in
computational linguistics. I will not go into details now, because I
plan expand on this, but I would like to state a couple of things.
Firsty, even though <span class="caps">NLP</span> seems to be mostly a Java-dominated affair (note
for example <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml">Stanford&#8217;s <span class="caps">NLP</span> toolkit</a> and <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">Sheffield&#8217;s <span class="caps">GATE</span></a>), the
[computational linguistics and psycholinguistics research center
(CLiPS)][] at the University of Antwerp actually briefly manifested its
devotion to Python and <span class="caps">NLTK</span> via its research director, Walter&nbsp;Daelemans.</p>
<p>It was good to see a little love for Python in this field. <span class="caps">NLTK</span> is very
underrepresented in the SciPy community, I couldn&#8217;t find anybody at the
EuroScipy conference knowing too much about it or about the people
behind&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Another lab that has done a lot of cool work is <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/cental">Cental</a> at the
Catholic University of Louvain, and they also use Python for natural
language processing. Maybe in the coming years, we will see a Python for
Computational Linguistics sattelite, along with Physics and
Neuroscience. Doesn&#8217;t it sound more fun?&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>Secondly, I wish <span class="caps">SSLST</span> were organized by someone like Gael! As the
discussion at dinner regarding who will organize next year&#8217;s EuroScipy
went, it is imperative that the organizers be actively involved in the
community, and generally passionate about it. Even though I&#8217;m comparing
apples and oranges, Carlos Martin-Vide behaved in this context like a
old, tired, emotionless academic, not taking into account even lunch
breaks for the whole group, not to mention any sort of getting together
or even a group photo (which, alas, we were not able to take, apart from
small groups.) They said it couldn&#8217;t be done. Of course it could, they
just didn&#8217;t want it hard&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Finally, before signing off, I would like to announce that because the
Romanian Ministry of Education failed to specify the allocated number of
public positions for masters&#8217; programmes, the admission exam at the
University of Bucharest will be delayed by a couple of weeks. Luckily,
this will allow me to attend <a href="http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2011/start3.php"><span class="caps">RANLP</span> 2011</a> in Hissar, Bulgaria a week
from now, where I will present my poster entitled:<br />
&#8220;Can alternations be learned? A machine learning approach to Romanian
verb conjugation&#8221; by Liviu P. Dinu, Emil Ionescu, Vlad Niculae and
Octavia-Maria Sulea. See you in&nbsp;Hissar!</p>
