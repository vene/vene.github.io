</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A while back, Bob L. Sturm blogged about a <a href="http://media.aau.dk/null_space_pursuits/2011/10/efficient-omp.html">similar implementation of
<span class="caps">OMP</span></a> to the one in scikit-learn. Instead of using the Cholesky
decomposition like we did, his Matlab code uses the <span class="caps">QR</span> decomposition, to
a similar (or maybe even identical) outcome, in theory. So lucky that
Alejandro pointed out to him the existence of the scikit-learn
implementation, and that Bob&#8217;s code <a href="http://media.aau.dk/null_space_pursuits/2011/10/omp-in-python-strange-results.html">exposed a bug</a> that all the test
coverage didn&#8217;t catch! This plot should increase, certainly not
decrease! Something is clearly wrong here.<br />
<a href="http://media.aau.dk/null_space_pursuits/2011/10/omp-in-python-strange-results.html"><img alt="OMP buggy phase transition, decreasing instead of
increasing" src="http://media.aau.dk/null_space_pursuits/2011/10/17/OMPscikit.png" title="OMP buggy phase transition" /></a><br />
Luckily we were able to find it and <a href="http://media.aau.dk/null_space_pursuits/2011/10/to-the-rescue.html">fix it</a> very quickly. I have
updated the old entries I wrote on the <span class="caps">OMP</span> optimizations, so they no
longer include the bug. But I take this opportunity to explain what
exactly went&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>A key part of the optimization was that slicing out arbitrary columns
out of an array is slow when they are passed to <span class="caps">BLAS</span> functions like
matrix multiplication. In order to make the most out of your code, the
data should have a contiguous layout. We achieved this by swapping
active dictionary atoms (columns) to the beginning of the&nbsp;array.</p>
<p>Something that can happen, but won&#8217;t happen very often, is that after an
atom is selected as active, the atom that takes its place after swapping
needs to be selected. This is rare because dictionaries have many
columns, out of which only very very few will be active. But when it
happens, because the code didn&#8217;t keep track of swapped indices, the
corresponding coefficient of the solution would get updated twice,
leading to more zero entries than we should have. A keen eye could have
noticed that the first `n_nonzero_coefs` entries in <span class="caps">OMP</span> solution
vectors were never non-zero. But alas, my eye was not a keen one at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>In other words, the following test (that was written after the bug was
found, unfortunately) was failing:<br />
[sourcecode lang=&#8221;Python&#8221;]<br />
def test_swapped_regressors():<br />
gamma = np.zeros(n_features)<br />
# X[:, 21] should be selected first, then X[:, 0] selected second,<br />
# which will take X[:, 21]&#8217;s place in case the algorithm does<br />
# column swapping for optimization (which is the case at the moment)<br />
gamma[21] = 1.0<br />
gamma[0] = 0.5<br />
new_y = np.dot(X, gamma)<br />
new_Xy = np.dot(X.T, new_y)<br />
gamma_hat = orthogonal_mp(X, new_y, 2)<br />
gamma_hat_gram = orthogonal_mp_gram(G, new_Xy, 2)<br />
# active indices should be [0, 21], but prior to the bugfix<br />
# the algorithm would update only [21] but twice<br />
assert_equal(np.flatnonzero(gamma_hat), [0, 21])<br />
assert_equal(np.flatnonzero(gamma_hat_gram), [0, 21])<br />&nbsp;[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Note that this bug has been fixed for a while, but I didn&#8217;t get the free
time to write this post until now. Good news is: we fixed it, and did so
very quickly after the report. So you can still trust me, I&nbsp;guess!</p>
