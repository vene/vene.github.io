</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last week was marked by the international <span class="caps">RANLP</span> (Recent Advances in
Natural Language Processing) conference, taking place in a nice spa in
Hissar, Bulgaria. The excellent folks from the <a href="http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/">computational
linguistics group</a> at the University of Wolverhampton were behind it,
together with the <a href="http://www.iict.bas.bg/EN/index.html">Institute of Information and Communication
Technologies</a> from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.<br />

I must begin by thanking them: the organization was impeccable! I&#8217;m not
sure, but I think that at one point Ivelina was even running around
buying routers to improve wifi coverage (which is already spectacular in
Bulgaria &#8212; I&#8217;ve received reports from <a href="http://pers-www.wlv.ac.uk/~ex0233/" title="Miranda Chong">Miranda</a> that you can get wifi
in the&nbsp;mountains!)</p>
<p>The schedule was busy, with three tracks going in parallel, in order to
cover a wide range of topics in computational linguistics. The student
workshop should also be noted for the excellent quality of the works&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Of course it would be infeasible to write about all the great people I
met and their high quality work. And if I were to write about all the
fun we had, it would probably make this post look unprofessional :).
This doesn&#8217;t mean I forgot about any of you, and as soon as I get the
chance to work on something related, I will most certainly write about
it, and&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>So, if I would have to summarize the trends and the ideas stated during
the conference and especially during the keynotes, I would&nbsp;say:</p>
<ul>
<li>When talking about word sense disambiguation, it&#8217;s wrong to speak
    about the different meanings of a word, but rather about the
    potential a word has for bringing a certain meaning in a certain
    context. See <a href="http://www.patrickhanks.com/">Patrick Hanks</a>&#8216; <a href="http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projects/cpa/">Corpus Pattern Analysis</a>. Without
    something like this, to have good <span class="caps">WSD</span> you need to heavily adjust the
    overlapping meanings from a Wordnet-style&nbsp;ontology.</li>
<li>Certain relations, such as temporal and spacial ones, can naturally
    be modeled by complex domain-specific logics (see [Inderjeet
    Mani][]&#8217;s new book, Interpreting Motion: Grounded Representations
    for Spatial Language, that is due for publishing). But these only
    appear in a small subset of human communication. The attempt to map
    human language to a complete logic in which to do general-purpose
    inference seems futile: <a href="http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/">Ido Dagan</a> suggests textual entailment:
    reasoning directly in natural language, and only abstracting away to
    a formal logic system when need&nbsp;arises.</li>
<li>If you have a large enough sample of n-gram frequency data, you can
    eventually beat the performance you can get with a limited amount of
    labeled data, and most importantly: it generalizes much better when
    going out of the domain you trained on. Apparently the best tool for
    this at the moment is the <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasets">Google n-gram data</a>, which has some
    limitations. In time, we can easily extend this data by huge amounts
    by mining n-grams from Wikipedia (which allegedly has a higher count
    of distinct n-grams than the Google dataset), and more importantly,
    by aligning multi-language data, making use of transliterations and
    cognate&nbsp;identification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that I may be (or most probably, am) ignorant of older
instances of similar ideas, and I may have misunderstood certain claims.
Please feel free to discuss in the comments whether you think I forgot
about something important, or whether I am plain wrong about something.
In particular, I seem to have been completely ignorant of the existence
of the Google n-gram data, which has been around for quite a while, so I
must have missed other important things as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Take care, kind readers, and express your opinion!<br />&nbsp;V</p>
