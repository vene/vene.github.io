<p>Positions are <strong>fully funded</strong> for four&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>The call is at <a href="https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/PhD-Candidate-in-Natural-Language-Processing-for-Video-Subtitling/761749302/">this link</a>, alongside instructions to apply. Please apply via that link by Feb 28&nbsp;(extended!). </p>
<p><strong>Emailing me:</strong> Don&#8217;t email me to apply: you must use the website or else I
can&#8217;t consider you. Do email me with any specific questions &#8212; please include
<tt>[PhD 11053]</tt> in the subject line so my filters can catch your&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>The most important part of your application is by far the motivation letter.
Please read my <a href="/mletter.html">advice for writing a motivation letter for me</a>.</p>
<p>In general my research gravitates around structured prediction, latent variable models,
sparsity, convex and constrained optimization, and geometry (machine learning on
manifolds.) Importantly, <strong>You do not have to already be an expert in these <span class="caps">ML</span> topics.</strong>
But if you have <span class="caps">ML</span> basics and you are enthusiastic to study one or more of these (or
related) topics, together with me, in order to apply them in <span class="caps">NLP</span> research, do&nbsp;apply!</p>
<p>The flavor of my research is to integrate structured and discrete
representations into the &#8220;soft&#8221; computation of neural networks.
See this captured in my <a href="/papers.html">recent papers</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The master&#8217;s degree requirement is unfortunately firm, and out of my&nbsp;control.</li>
<li>We are looking for a starting date of around March 2023. Please specify your
  availability in the&nbsp;application.</li>
<li>If you want to do your master&#8217;s at the UvA and work with me, emailing me does
  not help; you must apply <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html">to the
  program</a>.
  At UvA, master&#8217;s students usually are not attached to research labs, but me
  or my <span class="caps">LTL</span> colleagues can advise your thesis project in the second&nbsp;year.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t at the moment have the ability or the capacity to recruit interns or
  self-funded PhD&nbsp;students.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="advising-statement">Advising statement<a class="headerlink" href="#advising-statement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to be skeptical about working with an advisor who is early in
their career. Talking to their other students is always good: 
I am currently advising <a href="https://evgeniia.tokarch.uk/">Evgeniia Tokarchuk</a> 
at UvA, and have co-advised <a href="https://tsvm.github.io/">Tsvetomila Mihaylova</a>
and <a href="https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/">Gon√ßalo M. Correia</a>.
You can also write to me with any&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>The PhD is a job, and, <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/terms-of-employment.html">at UvA, PhD students are employees</a>,
with the workers&#8217; rights
that stem from this. 
I believe your PhD is not your entire life and identity. I encourage and try to
actively demonstrate <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/work-and-personal-life/work-and-personal-life.html">work-life
balance</a>, awareness and support of mental health struggles,
inclusivity, openness and safety.
The PhD is the time to learn how to learn, ask,
answer, describe, and teach. I will help and mentor you through it,
according to my ability and your requested&nbsp;level.</p>
