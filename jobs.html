<h1 id="open-phd-position">Open PhD position<a class="headerlink" href="#open-phd-position" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I have an opening for one PhD candidate in
Machine Learning for Natural Language&nbsp;Processing.</p>
<p>The call is at <a href="https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/PhD-Position-in-Machine-Learning-for-Natural-Language-Processing/750676902/">this link</a>, alongside instructions to apply. Please apply
via that link by Aug 21&nbsp;2022. </p>
<p><strong>Emailing me:</strong> Don&#8217;t email me to apply: you must use the website or else I
can&#8217;t consider you. Do email me with any specific questions &#8212; please include
<tt>[PhD 9665]</tt> in the subject line so my filters can catch your&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>The angle of this position is specifically on
expressiveness, controllability, transparency, and efficiency of deep generative
models of language. We will be particularly looking into overcoming the tension 
between the discreteness of language and the continuity of deep learning and 
taking cue from recent developments in continuous energy-based models and
diffusion&nbsp;models.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested in joining the team, perhaps this specific
listing does not speak to you, but you are interested&nbsp;in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty-aware generative models of language /&nbsp;conversations</li>
<li>Explainability methods for language generation and structured&nbsp;prediction</li>
<li>Adaptable, multimodal generation and&nbsp;translation</li>
<li>Use of context in natural language generation&nbsp;problems</li>
</ul>
<p>then I encourage you to apply anyway, and please mention this in your letter&nbsp;clearly.</p>
<p>We will rely on a selection of machine learning techniques. My research
gravitates around structured prediction, latent variable models, sparsity,
convex and constrained optimization, and geometry (machine learning on
manifolds.) Importantly, <strong>I am not looking for an expert in these <span class="caps">ML</span> topics.</strong>
But if you have <span class="caps">ML</span> basics and you are enthusiastic to study one or more of these
(or related) topics, together with me, in order to apply them in <span class="caps">NLP</span> research, 
you are a perfect&nbsp;fit!</p>
<p>The flavor of my research is to integrate structured and discrete
representations into the &#8220;soft&#8221; computation of neural networks.
See this captured in my <a href="/papers.html">recent papers</a>.</p>
<h1 id="advising-statement">Advising Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#advising-statement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to be skeptical about working with an advisor who is early in
their career. Talking to their other students is always good: 
I am currently advising <a href="https://evgeniia.tokarch.uk/">Evgeniia Tokarchuk</a> 
at UvA, and have co-advised <a href="https://tsvm.github.io/">Tsvetomila Mihaylova</a>
and <a href="https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/">Gon√ßalo M. Correia</a>.
You can also write to me with any&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>The PhD is a job, and, <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/terms-of-employment.html">at UvA, PhD students are employees</a>,
with the workers&#8217; rights
that stem from this. 
I believe your PhD is not your entire life and identity. I encourage and try to
actively demonstrate <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/work-and-personal-life/work-and-personal-life.html">work-life
balance</a>, awareness and support of mental health struggles,
inclusivity, openness and safety.
The PhD is the time to learn how to learn, ask,
answer, describe, and teach. I will help and mentor you through it,
according to my ability and your requested&nbsp;level.</p>
