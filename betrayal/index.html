            <h2>Curse your sudden but inevitable&nbsp;betrayal!</h2>
            <p>
                In life, love, war, and planetary colonization, even
                long-lasting friendships can end if one betrays the other's
                trust for his own gain.  We studied the language of betrayal
                by observing players of
                <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_%28game%29">Diplomacy</a>,
                the game that ruins friendships</em>. In this
                <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/531/got-your-back">very popular</a>
                game, players can
                form alliances and try to conquer the world together.  These
                friend&shy;ships sometimes survive, but often end in backstabbing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We found that there are subtle but consistent patterns in how
                people communicate when they are going to betray. Our
                computer-driven approach succeeded where the victims failed,
                picking up on these cues in spite of the betrayers' efforts to
                hide their nefarious intentions.

            <h3>Imbalance ruins friendships</h3>
            <img src="imba.png" width=300 class="plot right" />
            <p>Good relationships are well balanced, and we find evidence of
               this in linguistic parameters.  Three such features we
               studied are:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><strong>Positive sentiment</strong>: the average number
                   of positive sentences a player writes
                   <span class="orphan">in a message.</span></li>
                   <li><strong>Politeness</strong>: how
                   <a href="http://politeness.mpi-sws.org/">polite</a> a
                   player's requests are on average.</li>
                   <li><strong>Planning</strong>: how many words indicating
                   planning for the future the person uses in an average
                   message.</li>
               </ul>
                <p><em>Imbalance</em> is the difference in a measurement between
                the two players. For these three measurements, friendships that
                last (white bars) are not significantly imbalanced. In alliances
                that end in betrayal (purple bars), the betrayer is much more
                positive and polite, while the victim plans more.
                </p>
                <p>But are friendships doomed from the start? How early do
                    signs of betrayal begin to emerge?</p>
            </section>

            <section class="clearfix">
            <img src="time.png" width=300 class="plot left" />
            <h3>Dynamics change over time</h3>
            <p>We also examined how these cues vary as betrayal draws nearer,
               but while the two are still acting friendly.  When betrayal
               is far (4 or more game seasons) in the future, its seed might
               not yet have sprouted in the betrayer's mind: there appears
               to be no difference between the eventual betrayer and the
               victim. In the final moments of the friendship, interesting
               changes happen:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Betrayers suddenly become more positive, possibly
                        attempting to hide their duplicity.</li>
                    <li>Betrayers suddenly become <em>less</em> polite, after
                        having kept up a façade of politeness, during which
                        the victims were significantly less polite.  A <em>reversal
                        of imbalance</em> occurs right before the betrayal.</li>
                    <li>Victims plan more.  Making a lot of plans can put pressure
                        on the relationship and hasten betrayal, and, at the same time,
                        if the betrayer's mind is made up, there is no point for him
                        to plan.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>

                <p>Interpersonal relations are fickle, with close friendships
                often dissolving into enmity.  In this work, we explore
                linguistic cues that presage such transitions by studying
                dyadic interactions in an online strategy game where players
                form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal.
                We characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and
                examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal.</p>

                <p> We reveal that subtle signs of imminent betrayal are
                encoded in the conversational patterns of the dyad, even if the
                victim is not aware of the relationship’s fate. In particu&shy;lar,
                we find that lasting friendships exhibit a form of balance that
                manifests itself through language.  In contrast, sudden changes
                in the balance of certain conversa&shy;tional attributes&mdash;such
                as positive sentiment, politeness, or focus on future
                planning&mdash;signal impending betrayal.</p>
