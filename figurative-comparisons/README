Dataset of figurative and literal comparisons
============================================

This dataset contains a collection of 1400 comparisons annotated for
figurativeness together with the context in which they appeared.  The
comparisons are extracted mostly from Amazon.com product reviews (1260
comparisons) and from the general web (140 comparisons).

The dataset is further described in our paper:
    Vlad Niculae and Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
    Brighter than Gold: Figurative Language in User Generated Comparisons.
    In: Proceedings of EMNLP 2014

Description
-----------

We automatically extracted comparisons of the following forms:

  * A is _ like B (example: the device works like a charm)
  * A is as _ as B (example: the book is as good than the movie)
  * A is _er than B (example: the song shines brighter than gold)

The comparisons are first manually validated and then annotated for
figurativeness, each step performed by three different Amazon Mechanical
Turk workers (see the paper for more details).

The constituents of the comparison are automatically extracted and marked as
such:

  * Topic: the logical subject
  * Vehicle: the object of the comparison
  * Property (optional): what the topic and vehicle are said to have in common
  * Event: the governing verb setting the frame
  * Comparator: the trigger word (in our data, either "like", "as", or "than")

We constrain the Topic and Vehicle to be nouns and the Property, if present, to
be an adjective.

Files
-----

The dataset consists of two files: "amazon" and "wacky", consisting of
sentences from Amazon product reviews [1] and the concatenation of WaCky and
Wackypedia [2] respectively.

The "amazon" file contains 1260 comparisons extracted from Amazon product
reviews in the Books, Music, Electronics and Jewelry categories.  Relevant
information about the reviews is kept.

The "wacky" file contains 140 comparisons from WaCky and Wackypedia. 

Data format
-----------

The data is in a variation of the CoNLL format. Each sentence is preceded by a
metadata line in JSON preceded by an octothorpe.

For "amazon", the metadata contains all information available about the review.
Some interesting fields in the metadata dictionary are:

  * "figurativeness": the figurativeness scores from the 3 annotators 
  * "category": the main category for the product being reviewed
  * "score": the number of stars given by the reviewer to the product
  * "helpfulness": helpfulness ratings of the review.

For "wacky", the metadata only contains:
  * "figurativeness": the figurativeness scores from the 3 annotators 
  * "source": either "wacky" or "wackypedia".

The order of the columns is:
    form, lemma, pos, id, head, deprel, comparison 

The last column in the CoNLL format marks the head words of the comparison
constituents found in the sentence: the TOPIC, VEHICLE, EVENT, PROPERTY
(optional), and COMPARATOR.

Data preprocessing
------------------

The preprocessing is not the same for "amazon" and "wacky".

For "amazon", the reviews are tokenized and POS-tagged with TweetNLP [3] using
the IRC model, then dependency parsed with the TurboParser standard model [4].
Lemmatization is performed by Treex::Tool::EnglishMorpho::Lemmatizer [5].
Sentence splitting is performed using the Stanford POS tagger [6]
WordToSentence class with some custom settings [7]. 

For "wacky", POS-tagging, lemmatization and dependency relations are available
in the corpus, and kept as is.
