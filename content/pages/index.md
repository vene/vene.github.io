Hi! I'm Vlad [he/him]. I'm an assistant professor in the
[Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.science.uva.nl), at the
[Informatics Institute (IvI), University of Amsterdam](https://ivi.uva.nl/).
I research machine learning & natural language processing, focusing on sparsity
and structure.

I'm proud to be an advisor of some amazing PhD candidates:

  - [Evgeniia Tokarchuk](https://evgeniia.tokarch.uk/)
  - [Tsvetomila Mihaylova](https://tsvm.github.io/)
  - [Gonçalo M. Correia](https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/).
