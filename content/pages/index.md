Welcome, traveler, to my page. Enjoy your brief stay while you get to
know me!

My name is Vlad and I'm a PhD student in Computer Science
at [Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/), advised by [Claire
Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).
I am also a scientific Python developer, sometimes contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library.
I am collaborating with the [Center for Computational Linguistics at
the University of Bucharest](http://nlp.unibuc.ro/).
