# Job opening: PhD position in automatic video subtitling

Positions are **fully funded** for four years.

The call is at [this link](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/PhD-Candidate-in-Natural-Language-Processing-for-Video-Subtitling/761749302/), alongside instructions to apply. Please apply via that link by Jan 25. 

**Emailing me:** Don't email me to apply: you must use the website or else I
can't consider you. Do email me with any specific questions -- please include
<tt>[PhD 11053]</tt> in the subject line so my filters can catch your email.

The most important part of your application is by far the motivation letter.
Please read my [advice for writing a motivation letter for me](/mletter.html).

In general my research gravitates around structured prediction, latent variable models,
sparsity, convex and constrained optimization, and geometry (machine learning on
manifolds.) Importantly, **You do not have to already be an expert in these ML topics.**
But if you have ML basics and you are enthusiastic to study one or more of these (or
related) topics, together with me, in order to apply them in NLP research, do apply!

The flavor of my research is to integrate structured and discrete
representations into the ``soft'' computation of neural networks.
See this captured in my [recent papers](/papers.html).

# Answers to frequent questions:

- The master's degree requirement is unfortunately firm, and out of my control.
- We are looking for a starting date of around March 2023. Please specify your
  availability in the application.
- If you want to do your master's at the UvA and work with me, emailing me does
  not help; you must apply [to the
  program](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html).
  At UvA, master's students usually are not attached to research labs, but me
  or my LTL colleagues can advise your thesis project in the second year.
- I don't at the moment have the ability or the capacity to recruit interns or
  self-funded PhD students.

# Advising statement

It's a good idea to be skeptical about working with an advisor who is early in
their career. Talking to their other students is always good: 
I am currently advising [Evgeniia Tokarchuk](https://evgeniia.tokarch.uk/) 
at UvA, and have co-advised [Tsvetomila Mihaylova](https://tsvm.github.io/)
and [Gon√ßalo M. Correia](https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/).
You can also write to me with any questions.

The PhD is a job, and, [at UvA, PhD students are employees](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/terms-of-employment.html),
with the workers' rights
that stem from this. 
I believe your PhD is not your entire life and identity. I encourage and try to
actively demonstrate [work-life
balance](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/work-and-personal-life/work-and-personal-life.html), awareness and support of mental health struggles,
inclusivity, openness and safety.
The PhD is the time to learn how to learn, ask,
answer, describe, and teach. I will help and mentor you through it,
according to my ability and your requested level.
