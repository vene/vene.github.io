Well, there is [Averia](http://iotic.com/averia/) which is a very interestingly
built font.  You might have heard that people consider averaged faces to be
more beautiful. Why not do the same with fonts then? The result is awesome.

Also I found this nice looking one called 
[Alegreya](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya) and it works nice for
the body and hopefully bring a bit of variation to your life ;)
