So I got my hands of the [Google N-gram data][] for the Romanian

The Romanian word for coffee is *cafea*, and the more you crave it, the
longer you pronunce the final *a*: I really need some *cafeaaaa* right

Thanks to Google, here are the numbers:

Post scriptum: I hope you like the theme: I installed the [sane
matplotlib color scheme][] from Huy Nguyen.
